# Solidity Implementation of a Hashed Timelock Contract

This project contains an implementation of a HTLC in Solidity. It requires installation of [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/). Please note: this codebase is an educational example only and has not been audited. See this [article](https://medium.com/@huwgrano/exploring-htlcs-in-solidity-8f5cf6714bd6)
for a breakdown of the design.

To run the unit tests:

```
npm install
npx hardhat test
```
